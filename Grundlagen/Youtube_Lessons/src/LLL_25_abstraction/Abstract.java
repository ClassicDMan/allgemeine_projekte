	 * What is abstract class ?
	 * 
	 * Abstract classes allow you to create blueprints for concrete classes. But the
	 * inheriting class should implement the abstract method
	 * 
	 * a concrete class is a class that has an implementation for all of its methods
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Abstract Class is a class which is declared with the keyword abstract it can
	 * have abstract or non abstract methods
	 * 
	 * Abstract methods: it has no body: ex: void abstract testMethod();
	 * 
	 * Rules of Abstract Class: 
	 * - abstract keyword 
	 * - it can have abstract or non abstract methods
	 * - it can't be instantiated ( define an Object inside of it )
	 * - it can have final methods which will force the sub class not to change the
	 * body of the method 
	 * - it can have constructors and static methods
	 * 
	 * abstract methods can be inside an abstract classes or interfaces
	 *
